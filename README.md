# ai-research-copilot

A web-based AI research assistant powered by agents, RAG, and MCP tools.

## Overview ðŸš€

AI Research Copilot is a modular web app that lets you:

- ChatContainer with an intelligent assistant
- Choose from multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- Enable RAG to ground responses in your own documents
- Activate MCP tools (e.g., web search, filesystem)
- Observe how multiple agents collaborate on research tasks

Built with TypeScript, React, and Mastra, this project demonstrates full-stack AI orchestration, retrieval-augmented generation, and tool integration â€” all within a clean, modern interface.
